Features and user stories implemented
1. Uses web services to retrieve or store data for the app.
- New users' email and passwords are written to a web service database.
2. Provides registration and sign-in with custom accounts
- Test email is 'user@hello.com'; test password is 'password'
- New accounts can be made by clicking "register"
3. As a user, I must be able to see a graph/visual of my pet's health and happiness levels. (Priority: high)
4. As a user, I can log in and see the main app screenâ€”the kitchen.
5. As a user, I can click on the fridge and see all of the food choice available for me to feed my pet.


Notes
Google Sign in is not currently working correctly.
PlayActivity, QuickAccessFragment, and SettingsFragment are not yet implemented and can be ignored.
User Story 4 was not in our original proposal, but we felt it was high priority because without keeping track of health and happiness, there is no way to know when to interact with your pet nor any sort of gratification after playing with/feeding your pet.
The menu button and the back door button are not yet implemented.
